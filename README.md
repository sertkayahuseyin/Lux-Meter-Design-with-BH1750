# Lux-Meter-Design-with-BH1750
In this project, the measurement of the light intensity of the environment will be carried out using the BH1750. For the user to follow easily, the ambient light intensity will be continuously printed on the LCD screen and according to the light intensity, step LEDs and  buzzer warning will be given.
Arduino Nano, LCD screen, RGB LED, buzzer and BH1750 sensor were used in the project. The light intensity of the environment was measured using the BH1750 sensor.

The libraries, software and algorithm flow diagrams that I used in the project are given in detail in the file content.

The project is written in Turkish. It will be arranged in English form as soon as possible.
